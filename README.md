# sas-sample-mph-capstone
Base SAS code I wrote for my MPH capstone data analysis. This project involved generating age-adjusted annual mortality rates from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the California Teachers Study from 2000 to 2020. This code generates overall rates as well as rates by race and socioeconomic status.
